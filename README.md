#  Semi-supervised Facial Affective Behavior Analysis (ABAW2021 submission)
*(Submission to the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild ([ABAW](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/iccv-2021-2nd-abaw/)) 2021 competition)*

This repository presents a multi-task mean teacher model for semi-supervised Affective Behavior Analysis to learn from missing labels and exploring the learning of multiple correlated task simultaneously. 

For more detail, please check our paper: [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04225).
