#  Semi-supervised Facial Affective Behavior Analysis (ABAW2021 submission)
*(Submission to the Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild ([ABAW](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/iccv-2021-2nd-abaw/)) 2021 competition)*

This repository presents a multi-task mean teacher model for semi-supervised Affective Behavior Analysis to learn from missing labels and exploring the learning of multiple correlated task simultaneously. 
Our method is modified from **[Two-Stream Aural-Visual Affect Analysis in the Wild](https://github.com/kuhnkeF/ABAW2020TNT)**. We have modified the preprocessing method of rendering mask to provide better semantics information. After that, we extended TSAV model to semi-supervised model using mean teacher, which allow it to be benefited from unlabeled data. 

For more detail, please check our paper.
